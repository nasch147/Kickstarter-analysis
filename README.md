# A Study of Size and Seasonal Effects on Kickstarter Campaign Outcomes

## Overview of Project
This study comprised certain data pertaining to over 4,000 kickstarter campaigns launched between 2009 and 2017. The campaigns in the data set were located in over 20 countries and concerned a wide array of topics and subject matter. The goal amounts of these campaigns ranged from $1 to $100,000,000 USD. Key data in the set included catergocial data relating to the subject of the campaign, the campaigns' monetary targets and oucomes, launch dates and deadlines, place of origin, number of backers, and whether or not the campaign was a staff pick or spotlighted on the kickstarter website. Overall, the panel of data is complete with no matieral omissions of data in the set. Given the size and completeness of the data set, statistical inference across the set would be strong and relationships among the data should be able to be extrapolated to future campaign launches. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate trends and relationships in the underlying data to identify factors that have materially affected outcomes of the kickstarter campaigns in the data set. Specifically, this analysis investigated the efffects of the size of the monetary goal and the date on which the campaign was launched and their impact on the ultimate success or failure of those campaings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
